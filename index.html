      <h1>Some of my projects</h1>
      <ul class="gap">
        <li><a href="https://www.responsler.com/">Responsler</a> is a SaaS and my latest project. I built it to help
          developers better understand and debug HTTP communication.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.subline.watch/">SubLine Watch</a> is a smartwatch solution that I
          created for the manufacturing industry. It is a conventional smartwatch for end users, running my software,
          which turns the device into a single-purpose device that supports workers in their daily work.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/cd/whiskey-kinetics">Whiskey Kinetics</a> is a simple
          and realistic 2D physics engine I developed in JavaScript that runs in a browser. However, more than a PoC
          didn't come out of it, because I stopped the development at a very early stage.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/cd/Lynch">Lynch</a> is a JavaScript framework that I developed
          as a minimalistic alternative to established and bloated front-end frameworks. By now, the project is outdated
          and doesn't really have a right to exist anymore.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.liga.guru/">Liga Guru</a> is an AI that I developed to predict soccer
          results. It supports betting on sports events of the German Bundesliga by identifying irrational high odds of
          betting providers.</li>
        <li>Crillance was a fast-paced breakout logic game for Android smartphones that was a remake of
          the C64 classic Crillion. Unfortunately, it is no longer available in the PlayStore. <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GydOaZNa208">Only a gameplay video from 2015 still exists</a>.</li>
