# The Absurd Complexity of Web Development

I am developing websites (or web apps) for almost 20 years. The biggest challenge in the early days was to make the website work similarly in all major browsers. Browsers had a very headstrong behavior, so you had to create ugly workarounds. That was crazy shit ðŸ˜›.

Today, web standards are well implemented by all major browsers (to be clear: I'm not talking about the hottest features here). Workarounds are no longer necessary and new standards make work easier. So, life is easier today, right? Not at all.

The complexity of those days was replaced by extensive tools. When you create an app, you need a development server running on `node js`, `npm`, `babel`, `webpack`, `react`, `scss`, ...

Why do we need all of these today but not in the past? Do we write more complex web apps? Yes, but not **so** much more. And a lot of features you don't even have to code it by yourself because it is a standard function. A lot of dependencies are just needed in the development environment, there are not part of the app itself. Yes, they can increase your efficiency or improve your code quality. But it also takes a lot of time to install and configure these tools, read docs, keep it up-to-date and fix issues if something went wrong. A lot of time! Your development and production process depends on hundreds or thousands of packages. Do you trust every single package? Do you check every updated package? Of course not. But everyone is using it, so why should you be wary?

The thing is, the web is simple. You don't need all this stuff. You can create complex web apps without any framework or bloated development environment. The only thing you know is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Granted, those skills should be relatively resilient. But you should know it anyway. You have everything in your own hands. You have full control. Save time to learn various tools that will be out of date in a few years. Start right now and create an `app.html` and write a simple To-Do-App. You don't know how? Maybe you still think in framework structures?

Ok, maybe I exaggerated a bit ðŸ˜›.

I do not want to say that you should not use tools and frameworks. It is a very individual decision. But keep all the negative aspects in mind and weigh.
