      <h2>Liability for links</h2>
      <p>
        Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we

        always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
        violations at the time they were linked. No illegal content was found at the time the link was created.

      <p>
        A permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a
        violation of the law. As soon as we become aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
